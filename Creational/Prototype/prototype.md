# prototype

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

In real life, prototypes are used for performing various tests before starting mass production of a product. However, in this case, prototypes donâ€™t participate in any actual production, playing a passive role instead.
